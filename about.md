The personal blog of Anders Nissen. I'm a professional software developer by day, making a navigational aiding tool called SafePilot for nautical pilots. By night, I'm a very unprofessional indie game development enthusiast. This blog is primarily about considerations on the latter.

About me: I'm 30 years old and living in Aarhus, Denmark. I'm a Master of Science from University of Aarhus. My programming language of choice is [Haxe](http://haxe.org) and my ditto game engine is [Luxe](http://luxeengine.com).
