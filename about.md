You've reached the personal blog of Anders Nissen. It's mostly about nerdy game development related things. You have been warned.

#### About me

I'm a professional software developer by day, making a navigational aiding tool called [SafePilot](http://www.marimatech.com/products/piloting/safepilot-app) for nautical pilots. By night, I'm a very unprofessional indie game development enthusiast. This blog is primarily about considerations on the latter.

My programming language of choice is [Haxe](http://haxe.org) and my ditto game engine is [Luxe](http://luxeengine.com).

I'm 30 years old and living in Aarhus, Denmark. I have a _Master of Science_ from the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.au.dk/) at the [University of Aarhus](http://au.dk/).
