Game development has an incredible range of interesting topics to be facinated by. I've dabbled in a lot of the more minute, niche, topics. This post outlines some of the topics that I find very interesting right now and hope to revisit soon.

### Procedural generation
Procedural generation is a very broad topic, ranging from generating everything from levels, graphics, quests, music and more. Games like _Spore_ and _No Man's Sky_ and the demo scene take these concepts to extremes in spetacular fashion.

A gentle introduction to procedural generation is [cantor city](http://procworld.blogspot.dk/2014/11/cantor-city.html) that makes a very simple cityscape.

For a more detailed, academic, coverage of various topics in procedural generation see Ian Parberry awesome [Procedural Content Generation](http://larc.unt.edu/ian/research/content/) resources page.

_Lennas Inception_, a game that draws inspiration from _Zelda_ and _The Binding of Isaac_, has a lot of [good resources](http://bytten-studio.com/devlog//tags.html#proceduralgeneration-ref) about practical procedurally generating 2D levels.
