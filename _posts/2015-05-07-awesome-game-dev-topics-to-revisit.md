Game development has an incredible range of interesting topics to be facinated by. The diversity of concepts and algorithms that can be applied to game development is one of my main interests.

This series will highlight some awesome topics that I've experimented with but would love to revisit. The following unordered list are some of topics that I would like to cover in this series.

**Topics:**

* [Procedural Generation]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/05/07/topics-to-revisit-procedural-generation/)
* Shaders
* Steering/flocking
* Behavior trees
* Story/atmospheric
* Cinematic scripting
* "Raw" 3D
* Language parsing
* Ray tracing
